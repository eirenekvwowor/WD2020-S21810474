        <p>"Amazing Grace" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. 
            It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have been chanted by the congregation. 
            It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's Olney Hymns but settled into relative obscurity in England.</p>

        <p>With the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, "Amazing Grace" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world. Author Gilbert Chase writes that it is "without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns".[1] Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10 million times annually.[2] It has had particular influence in folk music, and has become an emblematic black spiritual. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. "Amazing Grace" became newly popular during a revival of folk music in the US during the 1960s, and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century.</p>
